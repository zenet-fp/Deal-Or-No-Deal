# Deal or No Deal (Python Edition):

This is a command-line implementation of the popular TV game show Deal or No Deal, written in Python. The game challenges players to test their luck and decision-making as they try to win the highest cash prize hidden in one of 26 sealed briefcases.

# Objective:

Select a briefcase to keep, then eliminate the remaining cases one by one. After each round, the mysterious "Banker" will offer you a deal based on the values still in play. Your goal is to walk away with the highest possible amount â€” either by accepting a deal or sticking with your original case until the end.

# Game Features:

Randomly assigned case values each game

Interactive prompts for selecting and eliminating cases

Option to accept or reject the deal at each stage
